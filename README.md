# POS_Tagging_Using_Structural_Models

Natural Language Processing has been a steadily growing and popular field in Machine Learning, it is concerned with giving computers the ability to understand language similar to human understanding. A tool within NLP is part of speech tagging, also called grammatical tagging, which tags each word in a sentence to a corresponding part of speech tag. This paper will attempt part of speech tagging using various deep learning methods particularly structural models to handle sequential data. The models that will be explored, and compared are; Structural Support Vector Machines, Hidden Markov Model, and Conditional Random Fields.
