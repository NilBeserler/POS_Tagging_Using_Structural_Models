# POS_Tagging_Using_Structural_Models

Natural Language Processing has been a
002 steadily growing and popular field in Machine
003 Learning, it is concerned with giving comput004
ers the ability to understand language similar
005 to human understanding. A tool within NLP is
006 part of speech tagging, also called grammatical
007 tagging, which tags each word in a sentence to
008 a corresponding part of speech tag. This paper
009 will attempt part of speech tagging using var010
ious deep learning methods particularly struc011
tural models to handle sequential data. The
012 models that will be explored, and compared
013 are; Structural Support Vector Machines, Hid014
den Markov Model, and Conditional Random
015 Fields.
